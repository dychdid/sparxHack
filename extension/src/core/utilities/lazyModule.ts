/**
 * @description Continuously tries to get a value from a callback and tries again every specific interval until successful or max attempts reached.
 * @param {function} callback - The callback to the module. This should be a function that returns the module which is requested.
 * @param {function?} condition - Optional condition for the finder to return the module. By default, only truthiness of the module is checked.
 * @param {number?} maxAttempts - The maximum attempts that the finder can call until giving up and returning null. The default is 100.
 * @param {number?} time - The time to wait before trying to get the module from the callback again. The default is 100ms.
 * @return {Promise<T | null>} - Returns the module if found or null if max attempts were reached. This must be awaited.
