# Deprecation Notice

Dear users of **Sintco Sparxmaths Solver**,

We regret to inform you that the functionality of our Sparxmaths solver extension has been severely impacted due to recent changes in the user interface and overall structure of the Sparx Maths website.

As a result of these changes, **Sintco Sparxmaths Solver** can no longer operate as intended. It may not provide the expected assistance with your Sparx Maths homework, and using its current state does not function

In light of these challenges and the uncertainty regarding future updates, we must officially deprecate **Sintco Sparxmaths Solver**. We advise all users to discontinue its use to avoid potential issues.

We understand that many of you have found value in our extension, and we appreciate your support.
